# How to do a uchardet release #

* Update UCHARDET_VERSION_MAJOR, UCHARDET_VERSION_MINOR and
  UCHARDET_VERSION_REVISION as needed in CMakeLists.txt.

* Update README.md.

* Commit the version change with the message "Release: version X.Y.Z."

* Tag your release commit with:

    git tag -a vx.y.z

  The tag message should be have the header "Version x.y.z released." followed
  by a list of new features or important fixes. This tag message will be
  considered as the release note, hence have to be carefully crafted.

  Considering that the previous release was va.b.c, you can read the full list
  of commits between a.b.c and x.y.z with:

    git log va.b.c..

  This should help you to build a proper release note.

* Push the release and the tag:

    git push
    git push origin vx.y.z

* Create a release tarball:

    git archive --format=tar.xz --prefix=uchardet-x.y.z/ vx.y.z >uchardet-x.y.z.tar.xz

Note: if you have not already set this up, you have to run first:

    git config tar.tar.xz.command "xz -c"

Cf. EXAMPLES section in `git help archive`.

* Compute a SHA1 checksum:

    sha1sum uchardet-x.y.x.tar.xz > uchardet-x.y.z.tar.xz.sha1

* Upload to annarchy download server:

    scp uchardet-x.y.x.tar.xz uchardet-x.y.z.tar.xz.sha1 annarchy.freedesktop.org:/srv/www.freedesktop.org/www/software/uchardet/releases/

  The archive and its checksum file should now be available from:
  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/uchardet/releases/

* Make the git tag into a Gitlab release (not automatic).
  It will be found at: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/-/tags/vx.y.z
  Just click the "Edit release notes" button, and copy paste the tag comment as "release notes".

* Update the wiki page: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/
  The release note link will be:
  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet/-/releases/vx.y.z

* Spread the good news!
